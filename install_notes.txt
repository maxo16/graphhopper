Make sure you have the java sdk installed. 

Have to make sure your machine understands java path variable.

Seems I have to add it to user variables as well.


Follow commands here once Java is set and Git is installed 
https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/master/reader-gtfs/README.md#quick-start


Make sure that there's a gtfs file in the same folder as graphhopper and a ".osm" file. 
input_map.osm  - can be downloaded using the overpass API
input_gtfs.zip - transitfeeds.com makes this pretty easy


After you've cloned the graphhopper repo and added the inputs, add the "run.bat" and "run_pt.bat" 
files into the graphhopper folder. 

Clicking on run.bat should run graphhopper for car,bike,foot
Make sure the encoding (around line 11) in this file "input_config.yml" is "car,foot,bike"


Clickingi on run_pt.bat should run graphhopper for public transit. 
Make sure the encoding (around line 11) in this file "input_config_pt.yml" is "pt"


*Note that in each of the batch files, you may have to play with the amount of RAM allocated 
to the JVM. If running graphhopper over small areas, you shouldn't need much at all. However, 
if the application seems slow at start up, it's likely because not enough RAM was allocated to the JVM.

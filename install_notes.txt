Make sure you have the java sdk installed. 

Have to make sure your machine understands java path variable.

May have to add user variable, that's how I had to get it to work. 


I've been used Git to clone the repo from GitHub but you could probably just 
manually download. 
Follow commands here once Java is set and Git is installed 
https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/master/reader-gtfs/README.md#quick-start


Make sure that there's a gtfs file in the same folder as graphhopper and a ".osm" file. I usually get them here: https://transitfeeds.com/ 
input_map.osm  - can be downloaded using the overpass API
input_gtfs.zip - transitfeeds.com makes this pretty easy


After you've cloned the graphhopper repo and added the inputs, add the "run.bat" and "run_pt.bat" files into the graphhopper folder. The bat files have to be in the same 
directory as the graphhopper. It may be helpful to add the timeout function, 
can help with debugging. 

Clicking on run.bat should run graphhopper for car,bike,foot
Make sure the encoding (around line 11) in this file "input_config.yml" is "car,foot,bike"


Clicking on run_pt.bat should run graphhopper for public transit. 
Make sure the encoding (around line 11) in this file "input_config_pt.yml" is "pt"


*Note that in each of the batch files, you may have to play with the amount of RAM allocated 
to the JVM. If running graphhopper over small areas, you shouldn't need much at all. However, 
if the application seems slow at start up, it's likely because not enough RAM was allocated to the JVM.
